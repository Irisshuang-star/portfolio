Painted in 1889 during his time at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, Irises captures the intense beauty of nature with a moving sense of calm and life. The vibrant blues and flowing lines remind me that even in chaotic times, beauty can still bloom.\nI also love to travel—whether it’s exploring historical sites, visiting art museums, or simply wandering through a new city, I find inspiration everywhere."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The study of Chinese opera in Western academic circles has undergone significant transformation over the past century. From early Orientalist approaches to more nuanced cultural analyses, Western scholarship on Chinese theatrical traditions reflects changing attitudes toward cross-cultural studies. This post examines key trends in this evolution and discusses the importance of bilingual resources for facilitating meaningful academic exchange.\n\n\n\nWestern academic interest in Chinese opera can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when travelers, missionaries, and early sinologists first documented these performances. Early accounts often emphasized the exotic and unfamiliar aspects of Chinese theater, frequently misinterpreting cultural contexts and aesthetic principles.\nBy mid-20th century, scholars like A.C. Scott and William Dolby began producing more substantive analyses that attempted to understand Chinese opera on its own terms. The 1980s and 1990s saw increased collaboration between Chinese and Western scholars, leading to more sophisticated interpretations that benefited from both perspectives.\nToday, Chinese opera studies in the West encompass diverse approaches including performance theory, gender studies, historical analysis, and interdisciplinary methods that connect theatrical traditions to broader cultural phenomena.\n\n\n\n1930s: First academic translations of Chinese opera scripts 1950s: A.C. Scott’s foundational studies 1970s: Increased focus on regional opera forms 1980s: Rise of performance-centered analysis 1990s: Integration with cultural studies approaches 2000s: Digital humanities approaches to Chinese theater 2010s: Transnational and global perspectives 2020s: Decolonizing methodologies and collaborative scholarship\n\n\n\nDespite significant progress, several challenges persist in the exchange of knowledge between Chinese and Western scholars of opera. Language barriers remain substantial, with many important Chinese studies never translated into English and vice versa. Differing academic traditions and methodological approaches can also lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities for collaboration.\nMy work on the Bilingual Bibliography of Chinese Opera Studies aims to address some of these challenges by creating a comprehensive resource that bridges linguistic divides. By cataloging and annotating English-language scholarship in both English and Chinese, this project facilitates access for Chinese scholars interested in Western approaches, while also helping Western researchers better understand the context of their work within the broader field.\n\n\n\nThe future of Chinese opera studies in Western academia will likely be characterized by increased collaboration, methodological innovation, and technological integration. Digital humanities approaches offer new ways to analyze and preserve theatrical traditions, while virtual platforms can facilitate global scholarly communities that transcend geographic limitations.\nParticularly promising are projects that combine traditional scholarship with new media, allowing for the documentation and analysis of performance elements that text alone cannot capture. As we move forward, maintaining a balance between respecting traditional knowledge systems and embracing innovative approaches will be essential.\n\n\n\nThe evolution of Chinese opera studies in Western academia reflects broader trends in cross-cultural scholarship. By acknowledging the historical limitations of earlier approaches while building on their contributions, contemporary scholars can develop more nuanced and culturally sensitive frameworks. Through resources like the Bilingual Bibliography and collaborative research initiatives, we can continue to bridge East and West in the study of these important theatrical traditions."

This post explores some of the methodological approaches I’ve been developing for the Ming-Qing Opera Prefaces and Postscripts Database project.\n\n\n\nWhen working with historical Chinese texts, traditional computational methods often fall short.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Zuo Ke (1893-1949) remains one of the most influential yet understudied figures in the development of Chinese drama historiography. His methodological approaches and critical frameworks have shaped generations of scholarship, yet a comprehensive assessment of his contributions has been lacking in both Chinese and Western academic discourse. This post presents preliminary findings from my ongoing research into Zuo Ke’s work and its lasting impact on the field.\n\n\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries who approached Chinese drama primarily through textual analysis, Zuo Ke pioneered an integrated methodology that considered historical context, performance elements, and social functions of theatrical traditions. His 1936 work “中国戏曲发展史” (History of Chinese Drama Development) broke new ground by examining regional variations and evolutionary patterns across different theatrical forms.\nParticularly noteworthy was Zuo’s emphasis on the relationship between dramatic texts and their performance contexts. He argued that scripts could not be fully understood without considering the performance traditions, audience expectations, and social environments in which they were created and staged. This approach anticipated by decades similar methodological shifts in Western theater studies.\n\n\n\nWhile acknowledging Zuo Ke’s groundbreaking contributions, my research also critically examines some of the limitations in his approach. His periodization scheme, which divided Chinese dramatic history into distinct evolutionary stages, sometimes oversimplified complex developments and regional variations. Additionally, his analysis occasionally reflected the nationalist intellectual currents of his era, particularly in his emphasis on indigenous origins of theatrical forms.\nDespite these limitations, Zuo’s work provided an essential foundation for subsequent scholarship. His comprehensive collection of primary sources and detailed documentation of regional traditions preserved valuable information that might otherwise have been lost during the tumultuous mid-20th century.\n\n\n\nWhen compared with other major drama historians of his era, such as Wang Guowei and Aoki Masaru, Zuo Ke’s distinctive approach becomes even more apparent. The following table highlights key differences in methodological focus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScholar\nPrimary Focus\nMethodological Approach\nKey Contributions\n\n\n\n\nZuo Ke\nPerformance traditions\nSocio-historical integration\nRegional variation documentation\n\n\nWang Guowei\nTextual analysis\nLiterary criticism\nGenre classification\n\n\nAoki Masaru\nCross-cultural comparison\nComparative literature\nJapanese-Chinese connections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracing the influence of Zuo Ke’s work on subsequent generations of scholars reveals his enduring impact on the field. His methodological innovations can be seen in contemporary approaches to Chinese drama studies, particularly in works that integrate performance analysis with historical contextualization.\nMy current research project aims to further explore these connections by analyzing citation patterns and methodological similarities between Zuo’s work and contemporary scholarship. Preliminary findings suggest that many current approaches in both Chinese and Western academia unknowingly replicate aspects of Zuo’s methodology, often without direct acknowledgment of his influence.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive reassessment of Zuo Ke’s contribution to Chinese drama historiography reveals both his groundbreaking innovations and the limitations of his approach. By acknowledging his pioneering integration of performance contexts with textual analysis, we can better understand the development of the field and recognize the foundations upon which contemporary scholarship builds.\nAs my research on this topic continues, I welcome insights and perspectives from colleagues working in related areas. Understanding the historiographical traditions that shape our field is essential for developing more nuanced and comprehensive approaches to Chinese dramatic traditions."

This post presents preliminary findings from my ongoing research into Zuo Ke’s work and its lasting impact on the field."

    "text": "Unlike many of his contemporaries who approached Chinese drama primarily through textual analysis, Zuo Ke pioneered an integrated methodology that considered historical context, performance elements, and social functions of theatrical traditions. His 1936 work “中国戏曲发展史” (History of Chinese Drama Development) broke new ground by examining regional variations and evolutionary patterns across different theatrical forms.\nParticularly noteworthy was Zuo’s emphasis on the relationship between dramatic texts and their performance contexts. He argued that scripts could not be fully understood without considering the performance traditions, audience expectations, and social environments in which they were created and staged. This approach anticipated by decades similar methodological shifts in Western theater studies."

    "text": "While acknowledging Zuo Ke’s groundbreaking contributions, my research also critically examines some of the limitations in his approach. His periodization scheme, which divided Chinese dramatic history into distinct evolutionary stages, sometimes oversimplified complex developments and regional variations. Additionally, his analysis occasionally reflected the nationalist intellectual currents of his era, particularly in his emphasis on indigenous origins of theatrical forms.\nDespite these limitations, Zuo’s work provided an essential foundation for subsequent scholarship. His comprehensive collection of primary sources and detailed documentation of regional traditions preserved valuable information that might otherwise have been lost during the tumultuous mid-20th century."

His methodological innovations can be seen in contemporary approaches to Chinese drama studies, particularly in works that integrate performance analysis with historical contextualization.\nMy current research project aims to further explore these connections by analyzing citation patterns and methodological similarities between Zuo’s work and contemporary scholarship. Preliminary findings suggest that many current approaches in both Chinese and Western academia unknowingly replicate aspects of Zuo’s methodology, often without direct acknowledgment of his influence."

By acknowledging his pioneering integration of performance contexts with textual analysis, we can better understand the development of the field and recognize the foundations upon which contemporary scholarship builds.\nAs my research on this topic continues, I welcome insights and perspectives from colleagues working in related areas. Understanding the historiographical traditions that shape our field is essential for developing more nuanced and comprehensive approaches to Chinese dramatic traditions."
