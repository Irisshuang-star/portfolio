## Who I Am

I am a PhD candidate at Hubei University, specializing in Chinese drama and digital humanities. My research explores the intersection of literature, performance, and cultural exchange, with a particular focus on how Chinese drama has been studied and interpreted both domestically and internationally. I have experience working with historical databases such as CBDB, and am passionate about integrating digital tools into humanities research.

## Inspiration

I draw inspiration from impressionist artists like Vincent van Gogh, whose work "Irises" (1889) resonates with me not just because of our shared name, but because of the way it captures beauty through bold colors and expressive brushstrokes. In my work, I strive to blend technical precision with creative expression.

## Interests

Outside of research, I love nature—especially flowers. The English Iris is one of my favorites for its grace and quiet strength. You’ll notice the background of this site features my favorite oil painting, "Irises" by Vincent van Gogh. Painted in 1889 during his time at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, Irises captures the intense beauty of nature with a moving sense of calm and life. The vibrant blues and flowing lines remind me that even in chaotic times, beauty can still bloom.

I also love to travel—whether it’s exploring historical sites, visiting art museums, or simply wandering through a new city, I find inspiration everywhere.
